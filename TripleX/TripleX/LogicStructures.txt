Trying to understand what logic loops and conditions I'm tracking or want to track due to bug with game end (GITissue#2)

I have;
1) LevelDifficulty (max 5)
2) RemainingGuesses (max 3)
3) Compare generated numbers to guesses ()
4) 


Various expected game conditions:
A) Correct guess - go to next level.
B) Incorrect guess - try again.
C) Run out of guesses - you lose, sorry.
D) Next level - reset guesses and codes. Try to guess.
E) Run out of levels - You won, game over.
