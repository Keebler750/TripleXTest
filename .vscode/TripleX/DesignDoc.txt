Lay out the required game structure here

Outline:
1. What is the basic design goal?
2. Concept, Win Conditions, Rules etc
3. How modular should it be, and what modules?
4. What variables and constructs will be needed?
5. Error proofing ideas - what can go wrong?
6. Other notes


Section 1 - Design Goals
a) Quick and easy playable console guessing game for Windows
b) Clear instructions, easy for all players to understand what's expected
c) Design obvious progression into difficulty to reward with do-able challenges

Section 2 - Concepts
a) Lay out a theme or storyline to make it fun
b) Game will have FIVE levels of increasing difficulty via amount of numbers and guesses
c) Generate some code numbers that the player must guess
d) Get player input and compare to the generated codes
e) If guesses are successful, player moves to next level
f) Player goes as far as possible to maximum of top level, which is a WIN.

We won't do this:
- Track score with 'Least Guesses High Score' etc scoreboard

Section 3 - Structure and Modularity
a) Menu, Levels, Code Generator, Messaging, Player Input, Comparison
b) Functions, perhaps reference variables or storage of values for use 

Section 4 - List of required code Objects
a) Codes, Guesses, Levels, Comparison criterion, Error Proofing, GameState


Section 5 - Error proofing
a) Minimize ability of Player to enter wrong input
b) Avoid GameState confusion
c) ...other...

Section 6 - Other Notes
a) Pay attention to efficient logic structures when you find good examples
